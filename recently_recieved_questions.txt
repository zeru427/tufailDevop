Demo your project?
Explain pipeline?
Experience in other technologies?

Arek Tecimler

Python DevOps/SRE

There were several questions about the pipeline I built from the assessment,
some soft skill questions like “tell me about yourself”,
“Are you familiar with other DevOps tools similar to Azure DevOps?”
“what’s the difference between Ansible and Jenkins?”
“Are you familiar with other containerization tools aside from Docker?”
“Are you familiar with other static analysis tools besides SonarCloud?”
“What is the purpose of static analysis tools? What business purpose do they server?”

David Rodriguez

Python DevOps/SRE

• How does your pipeline work?
• Why did you use a multi-stage dockerfile?
• How would you convert that to only use one image?
• How did you store you access tokens?
• How would you handle versioning of your tags using Docker?
• How did you set up the SonarQube analysis

Jacob Bulloch

Python DevOps/SRE

The interview focused entirely on the exercise and my solutions.  He asked about my strategy for tagging my Docker images in the pipeline, my multi-stage Dockerfile strategy, and asked to see my setup for static analysis and the results on SonarCloud.

All in all, I would say that he was mostly interested in the reasons that I chose the solutions that I did and my ability to explain those design choices.

He also disclosed that he was impressed that I was able to meet all of the stated goals in the time allotted time; he said that they did not expect any of us to actually finish the exercise.

My understanding of a multi-stage build and how and why to use it seemed to impress him particularly.

James Bromfield

Python DevOps/SRE

Interviewer asked me to describe the process I used to complete the exercise. Specifically, I was asked how to better secure the Docker images I pushed to a public repository, and when and why Helm should be implemented instead of using Kubernetes manifests.

Michael Darmawan

Python DevOps/SRE

Tell me about yourself.
Why did you decide to go into a tech job even though you were a Neuroscience major?

Could you present your pipeline to me? (and subsequent pipeline-specific questions)
  - the pipeline was a part of a 3 hour coding exercise we had to complete beforehand

7

Moonjun Chung

Python DevOps/SRE

Tell me about what you have done for your interview project.
What is a service?
Do you know what an Ingress is?
What is the load balancer doing?
What's the purpose of the selector in a kubernetes manifest?
Tell me more about the purpose of specifying ports and target ports.

Richard Hawkins

Python DevOps/SRE

We discussed repo branching strategies (did you follow a branching strategy in your assessment?), discussed the quality enforcement that devops can bring to a project (what are some checks that you would put on a quality gate to ensure good code is being deployed?), and talked about ways to design a pipeline to ensure new code integrates smoothly (how would you set up a pipeline to build and deploy new code?)
